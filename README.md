This is a GitHub repository for the project at the BNEM lab in 2024. \
The project aims to establish an AI model to predict the FRET value. 

# 1. Data preprocess
   This folder contains the Python code to sort data and extract features. \
   You can run the code files in the following order (please enter the input and output file names before running) \
    a. sort - Sort the sequences in alphabetical order \
    b. mean - Compute the mean FRET value for each sequence \
    c. pattern - Generate all patterns of 5 bases and determine whether they exist in the sequence. 
   
# 2. AI model
   Develop a Deep learning model to predict FRET values from sequences
